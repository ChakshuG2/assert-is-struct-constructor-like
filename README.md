## Overview

This repository provides a utility to check if a given value behaves like a struct constructor. This is useful for validating data types and ensuring that your JavaScript code adheres to expected structures. 

### Topics

This repository covers various topics such as:

- `assert`
- `assertion`
- `check`
- `is`
- `isstruct`
- `isstructlike`
- `isvalid`
- `javascript`
- `node`
- `node-js`
- `nodejs`
- `stdlib`
- `test`
- `type`
- `util`
- `utilities`
- `utility`
- `utils`
- `validate`

## Installation

To install the package, you can use npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install assert-is-struct-constructor-like
```

or 

```bash
yarn add assert-is-struct-constructor-like
```

## Usage

To use this utility, you can import it into your JavaScript file as follows:

```javascript
const isStructConstructorLike = require('assert-is-struct-constructor-like');
```

You can then call the function with the value you want to check:

```javascript
const result = isStructConstructorLike(value);
```

The function will return `true` if the value is struct constructor-like, and `false` otherwise.

## API Reference

### `isStructConstructorLike(value)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - `value`: The value to check.
  
- **Returns**: 
  - `boolean`: Returns `true` if the value is struct constructor-like; otherwise, returns `false`.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the function:

```javascript
class MyStruct {}

console.log(isStructConstructorLike(MyStruct)); // true
console.log(isStructConstructorLike({})); // false
```

## Examples

### Valid Struct Constructor

```javascript
class ValidStruct {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'ValidStruct';
  }
}

console.log(isStructConstructorLike(ValidStruct)); // true
```

### Invalid Struct Constructor

```javascript
const invalidStruct = {};

console.log(isStructConstructorLike(invalidStruct)); // false
```

### Using with Node.js

This utility works seamlessly with Node.js. Just ensure that you have Node.js installed and follow the installation instructions.

```javascript
const isStructConstructorLike = require('assert-is-struct-constructor-like');

if (isStructConstructorLike(MyStruct)) {
  console.log('MyStruct is a valid struct constructor.');
} else {
  console.log('MyStruct is not a valid struct constructor.');
}
```
